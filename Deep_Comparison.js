/*
The == operator compares objects by identity. 
But sometimes, you would prefer to compare the 
values of their actual properties.

Write a function, deepEqual, that takes two values
 and returns true only if they are the same value 
 or are objects with the same properties whose values
  are also equal when compared with a recursive call to 
  deepEqual.

To find out whether to compare two things by identity 
(use the === operator for that) or by looking at their 
properties, you can use the typeof operator. If it produces
 "object" for both values, you should do a deep comparison.
  But you have to take one silly exception into account: by a 
  historical accident, typeof null also produces "object".
